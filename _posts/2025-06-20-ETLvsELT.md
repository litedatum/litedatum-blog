**ETL vs ELT = "Prep dinner at home vs prep dinner at the restaurant"**

Both get you fed, but the timing and location are totally different.

**ETL = "Prep at home, then bring to the party"**
**E**xtract the ingredients from your fridge
**T**ransform them in your kitchen (chop, season, cook)
**L**oad the finished dish onto the party table

You do all the work at home with your own tools, then show up with a ready-to-eat casserole.

**ELT = "Bring ingredients to the party, cook in their kitchen"**
**E**xtract the raw ingredients from your fridge  
**L**oad them straight into the party host's kitchen
**T**ransform them using their fancy equipment

You show up with raw chicken and vegetables, then use their industrial-grade oven and food processor to make dinner.

**Real data example:**

**ETL (old school):**
- Grab messy sales data from 5 different systems
- Clean it up on your laptop (remove duplicates, fix dates, calculate totals)
- Upload the clean, final report to the database
- Like making a cake at home, then bringing it to work

**ELT (new hotness):**
- Dump ALL the raw, messy data straight into your cloud database
- Let the cloud's massive computing power do the heavy lifting
- Transform everything using the database's built-in tools
- Like bringing flour and eggs to work, then using the office's commercial-grade mixer

**Why ELT is winning:** Cloud databases are like having a restaurant-quality kitchen. Why struggle with your home equipment when you can use their industrial-strength tools?

**The "aha":** It's not about what gets done, it's about WHERE the work happens.
